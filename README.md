# gitNew
Testing using command line for git and github

little cheat sheat:

cd (folder) = change into folder if it is in the current one
pwd = path to the current folder

for creating repository
git init = initialze repository in current directory
git remote add origin "(link to github repository)" = links repository to local directory
git pull origin master = pulls master branch from repository
